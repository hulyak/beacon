## 🎬 Demo Script

### Introduction (30 seconds)

**[Open application on screen]**

> "Good morning! I'm excited to show you VoiceOps AI - a revolutionary voice-first platform for supply chain intelligence. 
> 
> Traditional supply chain management requires complex dashboards and manual data entry. VoiceOps changes that by enabling completely hands-free interaction with your supply chain data.
> 
> Built with ElevenLabs for natural voice processing and Google Cloud AI for intelligent analysis, let me show you how it works."

**[Click microphone button - should turn blue/green]**

### Demo 1: Risk Analysis (60 seconds)

**[Speak clearly into microphone]**

**You say**: *"What are the current risks in Asia?"*

**[Wait for voice response - should be ~5-10 seconds]**

**Expected AI Response**: 
> "I've analyzed the current risks in Asia. There's a high-severity logistics risk at 78% probability affecting major ports in Singapore and Hong Kong, with potential 15-20% delays. A medium-severity supplier risk shows 45% probability of disruption in electronics manufacturing. I recommend activating backup suppliers and rerouting through alternative ports immediately."

**[While response plays, highlight to audience]**

> "Notice how the AI provides specific percentages, affected locations, and actionable recommendations - all delivered naturally through voice. This analysis is powered by Google Cloud's Vertex AI using Gemini models."

---

### Demo 2: Scenario Simulation (60 seconds)

**You say**: *"Run a supplier failure scenario in Asia"*

**[Wait for response]**

**Expected AI Response**:
> "I've simulated a major supplier failure scenario in Asia. This would impact 65% of electronics production, causing estimated $2.3 million in losses over 3 weeks. Key metrics show inventory levels dropping 40% and delivery delays increasing 25%. I recommend immediately activating tier-2 suppliers and implementing emergency procurement protocols."

**[Highlight to audience]**

> "The system just ran a complex what-if analysis in real-time, providing financial impact, timeline, and specific mitigation strategies. This kind of scenario planning typically takes hours - we just did it in seconds through voice."

---

### Demo 3: Alert Management (30 seconds)

**You say**: *"Show me critical alerts"*

**[Wait for response]**

**Expected AI Response**:
> "You have 3 critical alerts: Port congestion in Shanghai affecting 12 shipments, severe weather warning for Southeast Asia routes, and supplier quality issue flagged 2 hours ago requiring immediate attention. All alerts include specific action items and affected regions."

**[Highlight to audience]**

> "Real-time alert management with intelligent prioritization - keeping supply chain managers informed of urgent issues that need immediate attention."

---

### Closing (30 seconds)

**[Stop voice interaction]**

> "What you just saw is the future of supply chain management - voice-first, AI-powered, and completely hands-free.
> 
> VoiceOps AI demonstrates how ElevenLabs' conversational AI combined with Google Cloud's intelligence can transform complex data into natural conversations.
> 
> Supply chain managers can now get critical insights while walking the warehouse floor, driving between facilities, or multitasking in any environment.
> 
> Thank you! I'm happy to answer any questions."

## 🚨 Troubleshooting During Demo

### If Voice Recognition Fails
**Fallback**: 
> "Let me demonstrate our text fallback feature - the system gracefully handles any voice issues by allowing text input while maintaining the same intelligent analysis."

**Action**: Use text input to continue demo

### If AI Response is Slow
**Filler**: 
> "The system is processing complex supply chain data across multiple regions and risk factors using Google Cloud's Vertex AI..."

**Backup**: Have expected responses ready to read if needed

### If Complete System Failure
**Fallback**: 
> "Let me show you the architecture and explain how this would work in a live environment..."

**Action**: Switch to slides/screenshots showing the system working
